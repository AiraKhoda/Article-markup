            <p>As you know, Apple wants to hold the WWDC 2021 Developers Conference on June 7 (June 17) at 21:30 Iranian time and online. We expect Apple to unveil the new features of iOS 15 at the conference, the final version of which will be released
                in September. Although there are still a few days left until the event, a person named Connor Jewiss has shared information about the new features of iOS 15 on the social network Twitter. Of course, we have to say at the outset that the
                accuracy of the information provided by this person cannot be verified, and it is possible that this disclosed information is incorrect, because this person has no record of disclosing such information. With that in mind, this person has
                said that iOS 15 has changes to the Dark Mode feature, the Messages app, and the Diet Check feature in the Health app. Of course, he also said that Apple has made changes in the iPhone lock screen and notifications settings in this version
                of iOS. Last month, Bloomberg analyst Mark Gurman said Apple wanted to improve the way users interact with notifications and update the iPhone lock screen. Gurman also said that Apple is working on the Messages app and wants to make the
                app more like a social network like WhatsApp.</p>

            <p>Gurman also tweeted on Twitter that "don't forget to update the banners when notifications are displayed." A new menu is also expected to be added to the iPhone lock screen and "Control Center" that allows users to choose their current status
                from among modes such as driving, working, sleeping or other modes. This feature allows users to make changes to the notification system depending on the selected status. For example, the user can specify whether or not to receive a notification
                sound in a particular situation. Users can also ask their phone to automatically send replies to incoming notifications in certain situations. Users can now use only the ability to automatically respond to notifiers while driving.</p>
